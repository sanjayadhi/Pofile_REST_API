so ihave first created a git resp
then a installed vagrant and strated using git bash to create a new vagrant file by vagrant up
and i booted up the vagrant eevn by vagrant ssh
then  i created a  vitual evn by  python -m venv ~/env and activated it.
then i have installed  pip install -r requirements.txt
created a django project and app in root vagrant directory itself

so after that i have created a urls-path connction to urls.py that i have created on my own.

then i have created model <data spaces in sqlite data base > for creating storing  the user superuser 
 and i have created the super user
 then created an api with 
 		an_apiview = [
            'Uses HTTP methods as functions (get, post, patch, put, delete)',
            'Is similar to a traditional Django View',
            'Gives you the most control over your logic',
            'Is mapped manually to URLs',
        ]
and
an viewset with
		a_viewset =[
                'users action (lists,Create,retrive,update,partial_update)',
                'AUtomatically maps to urls using routers',
                'provides more funtionality then apiview with very shortcode',
        ]
